# CVE_Mapper
The project is a system that integrates with Zabbix to collect detailed information about hardware, software, and manufacturers in the monitored infrastructure. It then searches the internet for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) related to these components, providing an automated way to identify potential security risks and improve the organization's cybersecurity posture.
